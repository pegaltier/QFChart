# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-22 - Drawing Y-Axis Range, Fill Overlay & Gradient Fill

### Added

- **Drawing Object Y-Axis Range Hints** (`_buildDrawingRangeHints`): When PineTS emits drawing objects (lines, boxes, labels, polylines), their Y-coordinates can sit outside the candlestick / plot range, so ECharts auto-scale would clip them. QFChart now scans all indicator drawing data, computes per-pane min/max Y, and injects **invisible scatter series** carrying those extrema so the Y-axis expands to include drawings. Applied during full render and on incremental updates (e.g. lazy padding).

### Fixed

- **Fill Overlay Inheritance (OR semantics)**: `fill()` between two plots now uses **either** referenced plot’s overlay flag — if **either** plot is overlay, the fill is treated as overlay. Previously both had to be overlay (`AND`), which wrongly placed some fills in a sub-pane.
- **Gradient / Invisible Source Plots**: Improved skipping logic for plots that exist only as fill sources: plot-level `color` of `null`/`undefined` (e.g. `color(na)`) is now handled consistently with fully transparent string colors, so gradient fills still resolve reference data without rendering a spurious visible line.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-19 - Line Drawing Tools, Layout Fixes & DataZoom Stability

### Added

- **Line Drawing Tools**: Eight new drawing tools, grouped under a "Lines" `ToolGroup`:
  - `RayTool` — 2-click ray extending from the start point through the direction point to the chart edge
  - `InfoLineTool` — 2-click trendline with an info box showing price change, percentage change, and bar count
  - `ExtendedLineTool` — 2-click line extending infinitely in both directions to chart edges
  - `TrendAngleTool` — 2-click trendline displaying the angle relative to horizontal with an arc indicator
  - `HorizontalLineTool` — 1-click full-width horizontal line at a price level with a price label
  - `HorizontalRayTool` — 1-click horizontal line extending from click point to the right edge
  - `VerticalLineTool` — 1-click full-height vertical line at a specific time
  - `CrossLineTool` — 1-click crosshair (horizontal + vertical) at a specific point
- **Dashed Preview Lines**: Ray, Extended Line, and Trend Angle tools now show dashed extension lines during drawing to preview where the final line will extend.
- **`coordSys` in `DrawingRenderContext`**: Renderers now receive the grid bounding box (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height` in pixels), enabling line extension and edge-aware rendering.

### Changed

- **Default Drawing Color**: All line drawing tools now default to `#d1d4dc` (light gray/white) with `lineWidth: 1`, matching TradingView's visual style.

### Fixed

- **`layout.mainPaneHeight` Regression**: The `mainPaneHeight` option (e.g., `'40%'`) was declared in the type definition but never read by `LayoutManager`. Now properly honored: when set with secondary panes, indicator panes proportionally fill the remaining space; without secondary panes, the option is ignored and the main pane fills all available space.
- **DataZoom Slider Reappearing**: When `dataZoom: { visible: false }` was set, the slider would reappear after any mouse zoom/scroll that triggered lazy padding expansion. The expansion code was hardcoding two `dataZoom` entries (inside + slider) regardless of configuration. Now maps over the actual current `dataZoom` entries.
- **Single-Point Drawing Crash on Scroll**: Drawings with a single point (horizontal line, vertical line, horizontal ray, cross line) caused `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'timeIndex')` errors during lazy padding expansion, because the update code assumed all drawings had exactly 2 points. Now iterates all points dynamically.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-18 - Plugin System Refactor, Chart Patterns & Drawing Tool Improvements

### Added

- **Plugin System Refactor**: Each plugin now lives in its own folder (`LineTool/`, `FibonacciTool/`, `MeasureTool/`, etc.) with a dedicated `DrawingRenderer` class, tool class, and `index.ts` barrel. Key architectural changes:
  - New `DrawingRenderer` / `DrawingRenderContext` interfaces exported from `types.ts` — renderers receive typed pixel coordinates and selection state, returning an ECharts graphic element.
  - New `DrawingRendererRegistry` — maps drawing type strings to their renderer; plugins self-register on init.
  - `DrawingType` widened from a fixed union to `string`, allowing fully custom drawing types.
  - `ChartContext` gains `registerDrawingRenderer()` so plugins can extend the render pipeline.
  - New `ToolGroup` class — wraps multiple plugins into a single toolbar button with a chevron-indicator dropdown.
- **Chart Pattern Tools**: Seven new pattern tools, each with its own multi-point drawing renderer:
  - `ABCDPatternTool` — classic 4-point ABCD harmonic pattern
  - `XABCDPatternTool` — 5-point XABCD harmonic pattern
  - `CypherPatternTool` — Cypher harmonic pattern
  - `HeadAndShouldersTool` — Head & Shoulders / Inverse H&S
  - `ThreeDrivesPatternTool` — Three Drives pattern
  - `TrianglePatternTool` — Triangle (ascending / descending / symmetrical)
  - `FibSpeedResistanceFanTool` — Fibonacci Speed & Resistance Fan
- **Fibonacci Channel Tool** (`FibonacciChannelTool`): Multi-segment channel drawn from two anchor points with configurable Fibonacci levels.
- **Fibonacci Trend Extension Tool** (`FibTrendExtensionTool`): Three-point trend extension tool projecting Fibonacci price targets beyond the impulse move.
- **Drawing Tool Point Snapping**: Holding `Ctrl` while placing or dragging a drawing point snaps it to nearby OHLC levels on the closest candle. Implemented in `AbstractPlugin` and active across all drawing tools.

### Fixed

- **DataZoom Hidden Mode**: When the DataZoom widget was configured with `show: false`, pan and zoom interactions stopped working entirely. Fixed by keeping the underlying event listeners active regardless of visibility.
- **Empty Chart Title**: Setting an empty string as the chart title now works correctly — previously an empty title was silently replaced with a default value.
- **Drawing Editor Point Placement**: Fixed a bug in `DrawingEditor` causing incorrect point snapping and state transitions when placing and editing multi-point drawing tools.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-11 - Canvas Table Renderer, Lazy Padding, Streaming Fixes & Rendering Overhaul

### Added

- **`TableCanvasRenderer` — Canvas-Based Table Rendering**: Completely rewrote table rendering from DOM overlays (`TableOverlayRenderer`) to ECharts canvas graphics (`TableCanvasRenderer`). All table cells are now emitted as flat, absolute-positioned `rect` + `text` graphic elements rendered directly on the ECharts canvas. Benefits: pixel-perfect sizing (Pine Script `%` maps directly to px via `gridRect`), participation in the single render pipeline (exports, animations, resize events), better performance for large tables, and correct z-ordering with other chart elements. Cell background, text color, border, font size, and alignment are all supported.
- **Lazy Viewport Padding (Edge Expansion)**: The chart now starts with a minimal 5-bar padding buffer on each side instead of pre-allocating a fixed percentage of the data length as empty bars. When the user scrolls within 10 bars of an edge, the padding automatically expands by 50 bars per side (up to a hard cap of 500). The viewport position is preserved across expansions via `_resizePadding()` — bar indices and zoom percentages are recalculated so there is no visual jump. A public `expandPadding(n)` method is also exposed.
- **Overlay Indicator Titles**: Overlay indicators (those rendered in the main chart pane) now display their name as a subtitle below the main chart title. Each subtitle is an ECharts canvas text graphic with a configurable `titleColor`.
- **`QFChartOptions.grid` Block**: New `grid` configuration option controls grid split lines and axis borders: `show` (bool), `lineColor`, `lineOpacity`, `borderColor`, `borderShow`.
- **`QFChartOptions.layout` Extended**: `mainPaneHeight` and `gap` are now optional. Added `left` and `right` string properties for controlling grid side margins.
- **Documentation**: Added `docs/layout-and-customization.md` covering pane layout, grid options, margins, and the new lazy padding system.

### Fixed

- **Custom Candle Colors** (`OHLCBarRenderer`): ECharts' custom series coerces all data values to numbers via `api.value()`, so string colors stored as data dimensions would silently become `NaN`. Colors are now stored in a closure-accessible `colorLookup[]` array keyed by bar index and retrieved inside `renderItem`, keeping the data array purely numeric.
- **`FillRenderer` Multi-Color Fill**: Fixed fill segments not applying per-segment colors when adjacent fills had different colors. Each polygon segment now independently resolves and applies its own fill color from the `colorArray`.
- **`FillRenderer` Reference Data**: Fixed fill plots that lost their reference data after a streaming update. `SeriesBuilder` now correctly propagates `rawDataArray` references across incremental renders.
- **Drawing Tool Coordinate Space**: Drawing tool points are now stored as real data indices (real bar number, no padding offset). When `_resizePadding()` expands the chart, stored coordinates remain valid without manual patching. On each render, real indices are converted back to padded ECharts coordinates by adding `dataIndexOffset`. Drawing series data entries are also rebuilt with the updated offset during expansion.
- **Polyline Renderer — Streamed Data**: Fixed `PolylineRenderer` not correctly handling incremental updates from live (streaming) data. The renderer now reconstructs point coordinates from the latest drawing object state rather than caching stale positions from the initial render.
- **Live Indicator Missing Rendering Options**: Fixed streaming indicator updates (via `updateTail`) not forwarding all rendering options (overlay axis map, pane offset, etc.) through the `SeriesBuilder` call, causing live indicators to render without correct colors and axis assignments.
- **Bar/Candle Background Renderer**: Fixed `BackgroundRenderer` not applying custom per-bar background colors when set via `barcolor` or plot background options.
- **Box Renderer Default Border Color**: Fixed `BoxRenderer` using the wrong fallback border color when `border_color` was not explicitly set. The correct default (`#2962ff`) is now consistently applied, and `border_color: na` still correctly suppresses the border.
- **Table Background Color**: Fixed `TableOverlayRenderer` not applying the table-level `bgcolor` when individual cells did not specify their own background.
- **Countdown Timer Display**: Fixed the bar countdown timer showing incorrect values or not updating on the last bar when live streaming was active.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-06 - Histogram Rewrite, Table Fixes & Drawing Object Improvements

### Added

- **Histogram `histbase` Support**: Rewrote `HistogramRenderer` from ECharts `bar` type to a `custom` series so bars extend from the configured `histbase` value (e.g., 50) instead of always from 0. This matches TradingView behavior for indicators like RSI histograms centered on 50.
- **Thin Histogram vs Thick Columns**: `style: 'histogram'` now renders as thin line-like bars whose pixel width is controlled by `linewidth`, while `style: 'columns'` renders as thick bars at 60% of candle width — matching the visual distinction TradingView makes between the two styles.
- **Resizable Indicator Panes**: Pane borders between the main chart and sub-pane indicators (and between adjacent indicator panes) are now interactively draggable. Hovering over a pane boundary changes the cursor to `row-resize`; dragging redistributes height between the two neighbouring panes in real time (throttled via `requestAnimationFrame`). Minimum heights are enforced (`10 %` for the main pane, `5 %` per indicator). The `LayoutManager` now exposes a `PaneBoundary[]` array in its `LayoutResult` and accepts an optional `mainHeightOverride` parameter to persist user-adjusted heights across re-renders.

### Fixed

- **Fill Overlay Inheritance**: Fill plots now automatically inherit `overlay: true` when both of their referenced plots are overlay. Previously a fill in an overlay indicator (e.g., Bollinger Bands) had `overlay` undefined, so it was placed in the indicator's sub-pane, stretching the Y-axis to extreme price-scale ranges.
- **Table Placement for Sub-Pane Indicators**: Tables from non-overlay indicators were always positioned relative to the main chart grid (pane 0). Each table is now tagged with its indicator's `_paneIndex` and the `TableOverlayRenderer` receives a `getGridRect(paneIndex)` callback to position the table overlay relative to the correct pane's grid rect.
- **Table Border Rendering Conditions**: Fixed spurious hairlines appearing between table cells. When no border or frame colors are set, `border-collapse: collapse` is now used instead of `border-collapse: separate`, eliminating sub-pixel gaps. Frame and cell borders are now only drawn when an explicit color is provided — previously a missing color fell back to `#999`.
- **Box `border_color: na`**: Boxes with `border_color` set to `na`, `null`, or `NaN` now correctly render without a border instead of falling back to the default blue (`#2962ff`).
- **Box & Line Extend Shorthand Values**: `BoxRenderer` and `DrawingLineRenderer` now accept single-letter extend values (`'n'`, `'l'`, `'r'`, `'b'`) in addition to the full words (`'none'`, `'left'`, `'right'`, `'both'`), matching the shorthand constants PineTS emits.
- **Drawing Line Spurious Fill**: Added `fill: 'none'` to the line element style in `DrawingLineRenderer` to prevent ECharts from accidentally filling the area under the line shape.
- **ECharts Palette Color Overrides**: Added `itemStyle: { color: 'transparent', borderColor: 'transparent' }` to the custom series config for `DrawingLineRenderer`, `BoxRenderer`, and `PolylineRenderer`. Without this, ECharts' visual system was overriding element colors set inside `renderItem` with its automatic color palette on re-renders.
- **Table Mouse-Event Pass-Through**: Table overlay elements now have `pointer-events: none` so hover, click, and drag events on the underlying chart are no longer swallowed when the cursor passes over a rendered table. Previously `pointer-events: auto` caused the chart to become unresponsive to drawing tools and tooltips in table-covered areas.
- **Drawing Object Y-Axis Decoupling** (`BoxRenderer`, `DrawingLineRenderer`, `LinefillRenderer`, `PolylineRenderer`): Drawing object renderers no longer encode y-dimensions in the ECharts data entry. Previously each renderer computed a `yMin`/`yMax` from all drawing object coordinates and included them as dimensions `[2]`/`[3]` with `encode: { y: [2, 3] }`, which forced the y-axis to encompass drawing object prices. This prevented the y-axis from adapting when scrolling to earlier history with different price ranges. The y-encoding is now omitted entirely; drawing objects are rendered purely as canvas graphics and do not participate in axis auto-scaling.
- **Box Fill Rect Stroke Leakage**: Added `stroke: 'none'` to the inner fill `rect` element in `BoxRenderer`. Without this, the browser's default canvas stroke (a thin hairline in the current color) bled through around the fill rectangle, producing a faint border even when `border_color` was transparent or `na`.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-05 - Gradient Fill Support

### Added

- **Gradient Fill (`FillRenderer`)**: Added support for Pine Script's gradient fill variant — `fill(plot1, plot2, top_value, bottom_value, top_color, bottom_color)`. The renderer detects `plotOptions.gradient === true` and renders each polygon segment with a vertical ECharts linear gradient, mapping `top_color` to the higher-value boundary and `bottom_color` to the lower-value boundary. Gracefully falls back to a semi-transparent grey if per-bar color data is missing.
- **`ColorUtils.toRgba()`**: Added a new utility method to convert any parsed color + opacity pair into a reliable `rgba()` string, handling `rgb()`, 6-digit hex, and 8-digit hex (`#RRGGBBAA`) inputs.
- **`ColorUtils.parseColor()` — 8-digit Hex**: Extended `parseColor()` to handle `#RRGGBBAA` colors (the format PineTS emits for `color.new()` with alpha), correctly extracting the alpha channel as opacity.

### Fixed

- **Fill References Broken by `color: na`**: Fixed fill plots losing their reference data when the source plot had segments with `color: na` (invisible segments). Previously, `plotDataArrays` stored the post-nullification array (where `na`-color points were set to `null`), so the fill had gaps wherever the source plot was invisible. Now a separate `rawDataArray` is stored with the original numeric values, ensuring fills always see the underlying data regardless of visibility.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-04 - Rendering Hotfixes

### Fixed

- **Plot Color `undefined` Treated as `na`**: Fixed a bug where PineTS emits `{ color: undefined }` (an options object with an explicit but `undefined` color key) to signal a hidden/na segment. Previously this was not detected as a line break — the color key existed but its value was `undefined`, which passed through the `null`/`'na'`/`'NaN'` checks unnoticed. The fix adds an `'color' in point.options` presence check so any explicitly-set `undefined` color is treated as `na`, correctly breaking the line/segment at that point.
- **Drawing Tools Clipping**: Fixed a secondary clipping issue in interactive drawing tools (trend lines, Fibonacci, etc.) that was introduced by the v0.7.0 render clipping refactor.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-27 - Box, Polyline & Table Renderers, Render Clipping

### Added

- **Box Renderer (`BoxRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `box.*` drawing objects. Renders filled rectangles defined by two corners `(left, top)` → `(right, bottom)` with configurable fill color, border color/width/style, optional text, and extend mode. Supports 8-digit hex colors (`#RRGGBBAA`) by converting them to `rgba()` for ECharts canvas compatibility.
- **Polyline Renderer (`PolylineRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `polyline.*` drawing objects. Renders multi-point connected paths from an array of `chart.point` objects, with support for straight or curved segments, optional closed shapes, and fill color.
- **Table Renderer (`TableOverlayRenderer`)**: New HTML-based renderer for Pine Script `table.*` drawing objects. Tables are positioned as DOM overlays anchored to fixed positions (`top_left`, `bottom_center`, etc.) rather than data coordinates. Supports cell text, background/text/border colors, full opacity control, and Pine Script's "last table at each position wins" behavior.

### Fixed

- **Render Clipping**: Fixed custom series rendering for drawing objects (lines, linefills, boxes, polylines) to properly clip to the chart grid area, preventing overflow outside the plot bounds. Updated `LayoutManager` to expose the grid rect for clipping and rewrote clipping logic across all affected renderers.
- **Constants Compliance**: Aligned string constants for label styles, line styles, shape types, and size presets across renderers (`LabelRenderer`, `ShapeRenderer`, `ShapeUtils`, `DrawingLineRenderer`, `LinefillRenderer`) to match PineTS constant names. This ensures PineTS output renders correctly without manual constant conversion.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-02-27 - Drawing Lines, Linefills & Label Improvements

### Added

- **Drawing Line Renderer (`DrawingLineRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `line.*` drawing objects. Renders lines between two `(x, y)` coordinates with support for line styles (solid, dashed, dotted), extend modes (left, right, both), configurable width and color. Handles `bar_index`-based coordinates with proper `dataIndexOffset` alignment.
- **Linefill Renderer (`LinefillRenderer`)**: New renderer for `linefill.new()` that fills the area between two line objects as a 4-corner polygon. Supports line extend modes, color/opacity, and proper z-level ordering (z=10, between candles and drawing lines).
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive Drawing Objects documentation page covering labels, lines, and linefills with data format examples, coordinate system explanation, and z-level ordering reference.

### Fixed

- **Label Renderer Improvements**: Fixed and improved label rendering with better value resolution and positioning.
- **FillRenderer Z-Level**: Changed fill z-level from `-5` to `1` — fills are now visible on the main chart pane (previously rendered behind the grid background).
- **Sparse Array Aggregation**: Drawing lines now store all objects in a single array entry to prevent multiple `var` lines (same timestamp) from overwriting each other.
- **Padding Offset Alignment**: Drawing line and linefill renderers correctly apply `dataIndexOffset` for `bar_index`-based coordinates, fixing ~60-bar misalignment with candles.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Labels Support**: Added support for labels on the chart (pull request #13).
    - Implemented `LabelRenderer` for rendering label elements.
    - Enables display of label annotations aligned with Pine Script `label.*` namespace output.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- **Price Line Visibility for Small Assets**: Fixed an issue where the `lastPriceLine` was invisible for assets with very small prices (e.g., PUMP/USDT at 0.002) due to default 2-decimal rounding.
    - Implemented auto-detection of decimal places based on market price magnitude.
    - Added `AxisUtils.autoDetectDecimals()` to intelligently determine precision (e.g., 2 decimals for BTC, 6-8 for meme tokens).
    - Updated `markLine` configuration to respect the calculated precision, ensuring the line is positioned correctly on the Y-axis.
    - Updated Y-axis labels and countdown timer to use the auto-detected precision.
    - Added `yAxisDecimalPlaces` option to `QFChartOptions` to allow manual override of the auto-detection.

- **Y-axis Scaling for Overlay Indicators**: Fixed Y-axis starting at negative values when overlay indicators contain visual-only plots (background, barcolor).
    - Modified `SeriesBuilder.ts` to prioritize indicator's `paneIndex` setting when determining overlay status, ensuring correct Y-axis assignment.
    - Visual-only plots (background, barcolor) now properly use separate Y-axes with fixed `[0,1]` ranges, preventing them from contaminating the main price Y-axis.
    - Overlay plots (EMA, moving averages, etc.) correctly share the main Y-axis with candlesticks.
