## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-27 - Box, Polyline & Table Renderers, Render Clipping

### Added

- **Box Renderer (`BoxRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `box.*` drawing objects. Renders filled rectangles defined by two corners `(left, top)` → `(right, bottom)` with configurable fill color, border color/width/style, optional text, and extend mode. Supports 8-digit hex colors (`#RRGGBBAA`) by converting them to `rgba()` for ECharts canvas compatibility.
- **Polyline Renderer (`PolylineRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `polyline.*` drawing objects. Renders multi-point connected paths from an array of `chart.point` objects, with support for straight or curved segments, optional closed shapes, and fill color.
- **Table Renderer (`TableOverlayRenderer`)**: New HTML-based renderer for Pine Script `table.*` drawing objects. Tables are positioned as DOM overlays anchored to fixed positions (`top_left`, `bottom_center`, etc.) rather than data coordinates. Supports cell text, background/text/border colors, full opacity control, and Pine Script's "last table at each position wins" behavior.

### Fixed

- **Render Clipping**: Fixed custom series rendering for drawing objects (lines, linefills, boxes, polylines) to properly clip to the chart grid area, preventing overflow outside the plot bounds. Updated `LayoutManager` to expose the grid rect for clipping and rewrote clipping logic across all affected renderers.
- **Constants Compliance**: Aligned string constants for label styles, line styles, shape types, and size presets across renderers (`LabelRenderer`, `ShapeRenderer`, `ShapeUtils`, `DrawingLineRenderer`, `LinefillRenderer`) to match PineTS constant names. This ensures PineTS output renders correctly without manual constant conversion.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-02-27 - Drawing Lines, Linefills & Label Improvements

### Added

- **Drawing Line Renderer (`DrawingLineRenderer`)**: New renderer for Pine Script `line.*` drawing objects. Renders lines between two `(x, y)` coordinates with support for line styles (solid, dashed, dotted), extend modes (left, right, both), configurable width and color. Handles `bar_index`-based coordinates with proper `dataIndexOffset` alignment.
- **Linefill Renderer (`LinefillRenderer`)**: New renderer for `linefill.new()` that fills the area between two line objects as a 4-corner polygon. Supports line extend modes, color/opacity, and proper z-level ordering (z=10, between candles and drawing lines).
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive Drawing Objects documentation page covering labels, lines, and linefills with data format examples, coordinate system explanation, and z-level ordering reference.

### Fixed

- **Label Renderer Improvements**: Fixed and improved label rendering with better value resolution and positioning.
- **FillRenderer Z-Level**: Changed fill z-level from `-5` to `1` — fills are now visible on the main chart pane (previously rendered behind the grid background).
- **Sparse Array Aggregation**: Drawing lines now store all objects in a single array entry to prevent multiple `var` lines (same timestamp) from overwriting each other.
- **Padding Offset Alignment**: Drawing line and linefill renderers correctly apply `dataIndexOffset` for `bar_index`-based coordinates, fixing ~60-bar misalignment with candles.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Labels Support**: Added support for labels on the chart (pull request #13).
    - Implemented `LabelRenderer` for rendering label elements.
    - Enables display of label annotations aligned with Pine Script `label.*` namespace output.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- **Price Line Visibility for Small Assets**: Fixed an issue where the `lastPriceLine` was invisible for assets with very small prices (e.g., PUMP/USDT at 0.002) due to default 2-decimal rounding.
    - Implemented auto-detection of decimal places based on market price magnitude.
    - Added `AxisUtils.autoDetectDecimals()` to intelligently determine precision (e.g., 2 decimals for BTC, 6-8 for meme tokens).
    - Updated `markLine` configuration to respect the calculated precision, ensuring the line is positioned correctly on the Y-axis.
    - Updated Y-axis labels and countdown timer to use the auto-detected precision.
    - Added `yAxisDecimalPlaces` option to `QFChartOptions` to allow manual override of the auto-detection.

- **Y-axis Scaling for Overlay Indicators**: Fixed Y-axis starting at negative values when overlay indicators contain visual-only plots (background, barcolor).
    - Modified `SeriesBuilder.ts` to prioritize indicator's `paneIndex` setting when determining overlay status, ensuring correct Y-axis assignment.
    - Visual-only plots (background, barcolor) now properly use separate Y-axes with fixed `[0,1]` ranges, preventing them from contaminating the main price Y-axis.
    - Overlay plots (EMA, moving averages, etc.) correctly share the main Y-axis with candlesticks.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

    - Split `Utils.ts` into specialized utility modules: `AxisUtils`, `CanvasUtils`, `ColorUtils`, `ShapeUtils`.
    - Improved code organization with better separation of concerns.
